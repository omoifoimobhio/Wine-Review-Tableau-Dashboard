# Wine-Review-Tableau-Dashboard
A created tableau dashboard analysing a collated reviews of wines from several countries. 
I visualised the total amount of wines,the total amount of wineries,the tasters who get to do the review and the varieties of wines in the dataset.  
I also analysed the top ten wines by point ratings, the top ten taster by the price class,the top ten prices by provinces etc.
